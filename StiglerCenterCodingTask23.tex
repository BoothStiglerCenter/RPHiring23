\section*{Instructions}
Please complete the following tasks and submit the required materials by the designated deadline. Ensure that you follow the directions carefully and submit all requested materials.

\subsection*{General}
Both the code and the results that you submit should be legible to your peers and those who would be your supervisors. That is, ensuring that your code is well-documented and well-commented; and that your written reports and data visualizations clearly convey your analysis is of the utmost importance.\\

Additionally, writing manageable and reproducible code is critical for research. For each task, please write a \verb|README| that describes each of the files that you have created/used and what each does. This should be written so that a user with a technical background but with no knowledge of the task itself can understand your code and reproduce all of the output products with minimal (if any!) changes to the code itself.\\

When submitting your materials please submit everything as a \verb|.zip| file. The name and structure of that compressed file should be as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    [firstname]_[lastname].zip
    +-- task1a
    |       +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task1a_README.md
    |       +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task1a.csv
    |       +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task1a.[py/ipynb]
    +-- task1b
    |       +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task1B_README.text
    |       +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task1b.csv
    |       +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task1b.[py/ipynb]
    +-- task2
            +-- [firstname]_[lastname]_task2.[py/ipynb]
    
    


\end{verbatim}


If examples are given, follow them closely. Good luck and have fun!

\subsection*{Disclaimers}
The contents of this coding activity are \textbf{confidential}. Do \textsc{not} share this document or any of the attached material with anyone. Sharing of these instructions or any associated materials will result in your immediate disqualification and may preclude you from future opportunities with the University of Chicago.

\section{Python and Web Scraping}

\subsection{\textit{American Economic Review}:}
Using Python, collect publication data from the \textit{American Economic Review}. Using Python and your choice of packages (for example BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or re) and Pandas, collect the following information for all available issues:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Volume and issue number;
    \item a hyperlink; and
    \item issue-date information.
\end{itemize}   


Store the collected issue-level data in a \verb|.csv| file. Your resultant spreadsheet should be structured follows:

\input{table1a_eg.tex}

\textit{Inside} a folder named \verb|task1a| save your README (use any widely used text format you desire, such as markdown: \verb|.md|), code, and spreadsheet as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|task1a_[firstname]_[lastname]_README.md|
    \item \verb|task1a_[firstname]_[lastname].csv|
    \item \verb|task1a_[firstname]_[lastname].[py/ipynb]|
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\textit{American Economic Review}: Redux}
Note that each article published by the \textit{American Economic Review} is labeled with JEL codes which describe to which field(s) and subfield(s) the article contributes. Each alphanumeric JEL code is associated with a human-readable description. Using the same packages as above, construct a \textit{second} spreadsheet that contains the following bibliographic information:

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item volume and issue number;
        \item issue-date information;
        \item the article's title;
        \item the article's author(s);
        \item the article's print page-numbers;
        \item a \textit{permanent link} to the article;
        \item the article's JEL code(s); and 
        \item the article's JEL code description(s).
    \end{itemize}   
\end{multicols}

Store the collected issue-JEL-code-level data in a \verb|.csv| file. Your resultant spreadsheet should be structured as follows:

\textit{Inside} a folder named \verb|task1b| save your README (use any widely used text format you desire, such as plaintext: \verb|.txt|), code, and spreadsheet as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|task1b_[firstname]_[lastname]_README.txt|
    \item \verb|task1b_[firstname]_[lastname].csv|
    \item \verb|task1b_[firstname]_[lastname].[py/ipynb]|
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Analysis}

For this task feel free to use the software program/suite of your choice. However, for purposes of reproudcibility, Stata, R, or Python are preferred.

For this task, you should have received  the following files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a
    \item b
    \item c
    \item d
    \item e
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Background}
In this short task you will conduct a preliminary analysis regarding the role of state-level institutional characteristics and donations to the electoral campaigns of state supreme court judges in the United States. In more than 20 states, state supreme court judges (the term used to describe judges who sit on that state's court of final appeal) are elected by state residents, rather than being appointed by a state executive. The merits of having elected, rather than appointed judges, are unclear. At once, elected judges both embody the virtue of being responsive to a democratic electorate and are subject to those same democratic pressures that may undermine their impartiality. 

\subsubsection*{Donations}
As with other elections in the United States, individuals and corporations can make contributions to a candidate's campaign; those contributions can be spent on making advertisements, facilitating a candidate's travel for campaigning purposes, hiring support staff, etc.\footnote{Note that direct donations to campaigns are \textit{different} from contributions to ``independent expenditure'' groups, so-called ``super PACs.''} Each state has slightly different rules about caps on donations and what must be disclosed when individuals or organization make those donations but in all states, those donations are a matter of public record.

\subsubsection*{Institutional Characteristics}
In the United States, the structure of each state's government is determined by that state's own constitution. Consequently, there is considerable variation in the characteristics of each state's judiciary. Examples of such characteristics include but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial selection method. Some states' supreme court judges are only ever appointed by the executive. Others must win election.
    \item Subsequent selection method. In some states, judges can serve until retirement age or for life. In others, judges must consistently run for re-election. The types of those re-election competitions also vary from state to state.
    \item The length of the terms (and if there is a limit to the number of terms) that supreme court judges can serve.
    \item The number of judges who serve on the state's supreme court bench at any time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task}

Your objective is to reorganize and clean the provided data, perform a preliminary data analysis, and write a short report describing the results of your work. Below are limited instructions -- a fully discursive set of instructions are not provided because we are interested in seeing how you independently work to ask and answer research questions. You may use some or only some of the files provided in your anlaysis.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

Please perform the above tasks and write a report discussing the key steps and decisions you made when exploring the data (and how those may have affected your results). Your object here is to use the data \textit{provided} to establish a compelling argument for the validity of your methodology and, therefore, whatever results you find. Your report can make use of tables with descriptive/summary statistics, data visualizations, regression analysis, or other qualitative information you see fit to include. If you do include regression analysis in your report, please ensure that each specification is at some point accompanied with an interpretation of those results.\\

Your report should also include a conclusion section that: 1) summarizes your results; 2) identifies the limitations of the dataset provided (and potentially your methodology); and 3) additional analysis you would perform if you had access to any dataset of your choice.\\

\textit{Inside} a folder named \verb|task2| save all of the data files your use, your README (use any widely used text format you desire, such as PDF: \verb|.pdf|), any code you may have written to clean/analyze the data and/or compile your report, and any miscellaneous files that might be required to reproduce your report from scratch. Please ensure that your report is submitted as a widely used text format. Acceptable file types include \verb|.docx|, \verb|.pdf|, \verb|.md| etc. Ensure that your \textit{report} is named as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|task2_report_[firstname]_[lastname].[pdf/docx]|
\end{itemize}
Other auxillary files should follow a similar convention but can be named as you see fit.
